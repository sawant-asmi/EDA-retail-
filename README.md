Here, I have successfully installed the parameters and constructed an analytical model for a Supermarket datasheet provided by the company.

What is Exploratory data analysis ?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for evaluating datasets in order to highlight their key features, frequently using visual techniques. Understanding the structure and substance of the data, identifying patterns, correlations, and anomalies, as well as producing ideas that can guide more research or modeling, are the main objectives of EDA.

Here are some key components of exploratory data analysis:
1. Summary statistics: Calculating fundamental statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, etc. is involved in this. These offer a brief summary of the distribution, shape, and central tendency of the data.
2. Data visualization: It is the process of employing graphs, charts, and plots to portray the data visually. Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar charts, etc. are examples of standard visualizations.
3. Data cleaning: It entails addressing missing numbers, outliers, and any other problems with the quality of the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the analysis is founded on accurate data.
4. Finding Trends and Patterns: EDA aids in finding trends and patterns in the data. This may entail detecting clusters in multivariate data, searching for seasonality in time series data, etc.
5. Relationships and correlations: EDA aids in understanding the connections between various variables. Correlation analysis, scatter plots, and other techniques can be used to accomplish this.

How can EDA be used in the retail sector?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is highly valuable in the retail sector for gaining insights, making informed decisions, and improving various aspects of the business. 
some specific applications used in the retail industry are Customer Segmentation, Inventory Management, Price Optimization, Promotion Effectiveness, Market Basket Analysis, Seasonal Trends and Demand Forecasting, Customer Behavior Analysis, Location Analysis, Supplier Performance, Geographical Expansion and many more.

12. Profit and discount are inversely correlated.
13. The three states with the most transactions are Texas, New York, and California.
14. South Dakota has the lowest sales at 0.8%, while Wyoming has the fewest transactions but the largest sales volume at 11.8% of all sales.
